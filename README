/* ===========================================================
    This is a silly project that we created to experiment
    with HTML5, CSS3 and mobile web concepts.

    Background: Delores is our DEV chicken. Each morning we
    "squeeze the chicken" to indicate the SCRUM is about to
    begin.  This mobile web page allows us to fire the call
    of the chicken no matter where we may be.
